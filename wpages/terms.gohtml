If you object to any changes to the Services, your sole recourse will be to cease using the Services. Continued use of the Services following posting of any such changes will indicate your acknowledgement of such changes and satisfaction with the Services as modified.

                          <p class="mt-4 mx-3 md:mt-4 md:mx-8">(a) Subscriptions. Your Subscription or commencement of the Services shall begin upon confirmation to You and receipt of lawful funds, whichever comes earlier. The Subscription initial term's length is chosen by You and shall be indicated when You subscribe to Our Services. The Subscription may not be terminated by You during the Initial Term (and any renewals thereof) except in the event of a breach by LxRoot. After the Initial Term, the Subscription shall automatically renew for successive terms, equal in length to the Initial Term, unless terminated or canceled by either party as provided herein.</p>
                          <p class="mt-4 mx-3 md:mt-4 md:mx-8">(b) Pricing. Subject to Section 3(c), LxRoot reserves the right to change prices for paid Subscriptions at any time and does not provide price protection or refunds in the event of promotions or price decreases. Any pricing changes will become effective after your then-current Subscription expires or terminates. You understand that if We agree to provide Services to You in the future after your Subscription terminates for any reason, the amount You paid under any prior term or time period is not determinative of the amount You will pay should We provide Services to You again. It is Your responsibility to check Our Site for plan or price changes should You wish to take advantage of plan or price changes which may have occurred. LxRoot does not automatically update Your Subscription plan. All upgrades or downgrades will be performed at Your request and may include modification Fees (defend in Section 7(a)) or require reinitiating service with Us.</p>
                          <p class="mt-4 mx-3 md:mt-4 md:mx-8">(c) Automatic Renewal Terms: To facilitate continuity of the Services to you, each paid Subscription contains automatic renewal terms. LxRoot will automatically renew your paid Subscription as per the Subscription period of your choosing (each a “Subscription Term”), on the anniversary of that date that LxRoot first charges your Account for the first Subscription fee, and, as authorized by you during the Subscription sign-up process, LxRoot will charge your Account with the applicable Subscription fee and any sales or similar taxes that may be imposed on your Subscription fee payment (unless you cancel prior to the anniversary date). Each Subscription renewal period is for the same Subscription Term as the prior one, unless otherwise agreed between you and LxRoot. IF YOU CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION, YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICES WILL BE SHUT OFF ONCE YOUR THEN CURRENT SUBSCRIPTION TERM EXPIRES.</p>
                          <p class="mt-4 mx-3 md:mt-4 md:mx-8">LxRoot reserves the right to modify pricing at any time (but not the price in effect for your then-current Subscription Term), upon advance notice to you. If you have not canceled your Subscription or turned off the auto-renew function within the specified time after receiving notice of a price change, your Subscription will auto-renew at the price indicated in your notice.</p>
                          <p class="mt-4 mx-3 md:mt-4 md:mx-8">(d) CANCELLATION TERMS: YOU MAY CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION AT ANY TIME, AND SUCH CANCELLATION SHALL BECOME EFFECTIVE UPON EXPIRATION OF YOUR THEN-CURRENT SUBSCRIPTION TERM. You agree and understand that you will be charged Subscription fees until the expiration of your then-current Subscription Term and SUBSCRIPTION FEES WILL NOT BE REFUNDED, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, SUBJECT TO APPLICABLE LAW. You will not be eligible for a pro-rated refund of any portion of the Subscription fees paid for any unused days of the then-current Subscription Term. If you have any problems or concerns with your cancellation please contact us at support@LxRoot.com for assistance.</p>

                          <p class="mt-4 mx-3 md:mt-4 md:mx-8">(a) If you purchase any Services that we offer for a fee, either on a one-time or on a Subscription basis (collectively “Fees”), you agree and consent to LxRoot’s use of third-party payment providers for billing and processing online payments (see below), and you agree to pay the applicable Fees for the Services (including, without limitation, periodic fees for Subscriptions) as they become due, plus all related taxes, and to reimburse us for all collection costs and interest for any overdue amounts. Unless separately negotiated by You and Us, and confirmed by separate written agreement, the initial and recurring Fees for the Services selected by You shall be as provided in the initial on-line order form. All set-up fees and special programming fees are non-refundable. Unless otherwise indicated, we may invoice Fees for Services in advance. Failure to make payment of Fees for Services when due may result in the suspension or termination of Services.</p>
                          <p class="mt-4 mx-3 md:mt-4 md:mx-8">(b) Services are billed on an automatic, auto-renewal and recurring basis unless and until you follow LxRoot's cancellation procedure set forth in this Agreement. Your obligation to pay fees continues through the end of the Subscription Term (defined in Section 6(c)). Our Subscriptions may be subject to usage limits. You agree and understand that we verify use of the Service periodically. If as part of a routine verification process, we determine that Usage exceeds the current amount of usage limits purchased, we reserve the right to invoice you for the additional use. We may contact you to discuss your current plan and other options available to you. You agree to upgrade to a higher usage plan if necessary.</p>

                          <p class="mt-4 mx-3 md:mt-4 md:mx-8">(c) At the time of registration, you must select a payment method. By providing a payment method, you expressly authorize LxRoot to charge said payment method at regular intervals subject to Your Particular Subscription. LxRoot reserves the right to contract with a third party to process all payments. Such third party may impose additional terms and conditions governing payment processing. If You do not pay all Fees when due, your account will be deemed past due. For any past due Fees, LxRoot reserves the right to charge You interest at five percent (5%) or the highest rate allowed by applicable law, whichever is lower, per month of the unpaid amount, until paid.</p>
                          <p class="mt-4 mx-3 md:mt-4 md:mx-8">(d) You agree to pay any and all taxes, including personal property, value added, or sales taxes, resulting from Your use of the Services. LxRoot is not responsible for any bank fees incurred by You due to Your use of check cards, automatic payment services, insufficient funds, and any and all other fees your financial institution may impose due to Your use of the Services. If LxRoot should receive less than full payment of the Fees due to taxes, bank charges, transfer fees, or the like, LxRoot will invoice You for the difference between payment received and the Fees due. You also agree to pay all attorney and collection fees arising from LxRoot's efforts to collect any past-due Fees.</p>

                          <p class="mt-4 mx-3 md:mt-4 md:mx-8">(e) If you cancel any Service prior to the expiration of the pre-paid Fees, you understand and agree that LxRoot, at its sole discretion, may not issue You any refund whatsoever, including but not limited to any remaining pre-paid Fees, set up Fees, and/or special programming Fees. Any refunds, if any, will be refunded to the original method of payment only.</p>
                          <p class="mt-4 mx-3 md:mt-4 md:mx-8">(f) If you do not pay on time or if LxRoot cannot charge your payment method for any reason, LxRoot reserves the right to either suspend or terminate your Subscription, access to the Services, and/or Account and terminate these Terms.</p>
                          
                          <p class="mt-4 mx-3 md:mt-4 md:mx-8">(g) Coupons and Discount Codes. From time to time, LxRoot may offer coupons or other discount codes which may be used when signing up for Services with Us. Coupons and discount codes are for first-time customers of LxRoot only and must be used at the time of Your initial purchase with Us – they may not be applied after commencement of the Services. Unless expressly provided, such coupons and discount codes may not be used toward upgrades to Your account. Any account We deem to be attempting unauthorized coupon or discount code use may be subject to Termination for Cause (see Section 9).</p>

In such case, LxRoot will provide You with thirty (30) days written notice before the discontinuation of Services. If LxRoot cancels your Subscription pursuant to any of the terms outlined in these Terms, with the exception of Termination without Cause, LxRoot shall not refund to You any fees paid or prepaid in advance of such cancellation and You shall be obligated to pay all fees and charges accrued prior to the effectiveness of such cancellation. In the event that LxRoot terminates the Agreement for cause, all prepaid Fees will be forfeited and are not refundable. The termination of your Subscription does not relieve You of Your obligation to pay any Fees accrued or payable to LxRoot prior to the effective date of termination of your Subscription.</p>
                          <p class="mt-4 mx-3 md:mt-4 md:mx-8">(b) In addition to LxRoot's right to terminate your Subscription provided elsewhere in these Terms, LxRoot may terminate your Subscription effective immediately if, based on LxRoot's sole judgment, it determines that You or any of Your end users: (i) have breached the Acceptable Use Policy ("AUP") or Anti-Spam Policy, (ii) have infringed or violated any intellectual property right or privacy or publicity right of a third party, (iii) have not complied with any applicable law, statute or regulation, or (iv) have uploaded, published or disseminated any images, text, graphics, code or video which LxRoot considers illegal or high risk, in its discretion, or (v) breached these Terms. Nothing contained in these Terms is intended to, or shall, impose any duty or obligation upon LxRoot to monitor or review Your Content (defined in Section 12) or the content of Your end users at any time. You remain solely responsible for Your Content, and any liability generated therefrom.</p>

                          <p class="mt-4 mx-3 md:mt-4 md:mx-8">(c) The termination of your Subscription will end Your access to the Services and Your license to the Materials. LxRoot shall not be liable to You or to any third party for termination of the Services permitted under these Terms. Upon termination of your Subscription, LxRoot reserves the right to maintain copies of Your data flees and records for archival purposes but does not undertake any obligation to do so.

You agree that at all times You shall be compliant with HIPAA and HITECH requirements, as applicable, including full compliance when configuring your Configurable HIPAA Server.</p>

When contracting with LxRoot for this service, we will provide you with the applicable documentation, including a list of your obligations, and you agree and understand that you will undergo an architectural review before you can deploy your HIPAA Server, and that you will execute an acknowledgement with LxRoot to this effect.</p>

You agree to comply with all applicable state and federal laws and rules in connection with Your collection, security, and dissemination of any protected health information (“PHI”) on Your HIPAA Server. If we believe that it is necessary based on Your implementation and we request it of You, then You will promptly provide us with documentation evidencing Your compliance with HIPAA and HITECH.</p> 
                            <p class="mt-4 mx-3 md:mt-4 md:mx-8">You also agree that You will use only HIPAA compliant service providers in connection with the storage, or transmission of PHI. Information on the HIPAA rules can be found on the HHS website. It is Your responsibility to comply with these standards. As long as Your Account is active, you shall be responsible for managing, retaining and backing up any of Your Content. </p>
                            <p class="mt-4 mx-3 md:mt-4 md:mx-8">LxRoot does not have access to Customer Content stored within HIPAA Servers; nor do we provide backup services. Other than as required by applicable law or legal process or as otherwise agreed, LxRoot shall not be responsible for retaining a HIPAA Server or Your Content after account termination or for archiving purposes. You acknowledge that, unless you instruct us otherwise, all Content will be securely deleted by LxRoot after the account is terminated, subject to these Terms. We provide certification of destruction if required.</p>

                            <p class="mt-4 mx-3 md:mt-4 md:mx-8">Please read this carefully if you are a resident of the United States of America. It affects your rights.</p> 
                            <p class="mt-4 mx-3 md:mt-4 md:mx-8">(a) Applicable Law. These Terms and any dispute that may arise between you and LxRoot shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law and the laws of the State of New Jersey, United States of America, excluding its rules regarding conflicts of law. You agree that any claim or dispute you may have against LxRoot must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in Palm Beach County, Florida, except as otherwise agreed by the parties or as described in the Arbitration subsection below. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in Palm Beach County, Florida for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes.</p>
                            
                            <p class="mt-4 mx-3 md:mt-4 md:mx-8">(b) Dispute Resolution. Before either party may seek arbitration as provided below, the party must first send to the other party a written notice of dispute (“Notice") describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief. After the Notice is received, you and LxRoot may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally. If you and LxRoot do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding as provided below.</p>
                            <p class="mt-4 mx-3 md:mt-4 md:mx-8">(c) Arbitration. You agree that LxRoot may elect to resolve the dispute in a cost-effective manner through binding arbitration (including non-appearance-based arbitration). In the event LxRoot elects arbitration, you hereby agree to move any claims to the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitration procedure, which shall be initiated through the American Arbitration Association or another established alternative dispute resolution provider (collectively, “ADR”) chosen by LxRoot. The ADR provider and the parties must comply with the following rules: (i) at LxRoot’s option, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; (ii) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties, in which case the location of the arbitration shall be Palm Beach County, Florida, and (iii) the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Arbitration expressly excludes claims for injunctive or other equitable relief. Arbitral Claims shall include, but are not limited to, contract and tort claims of all kinds, and all claims based on any federal, state or local law, statute, or regulation, excepting only claims under applicable worker's compensation law, unemployment insurance claims, intellectual property claims, actions for injunctions, attachment, garnishment, and other equitable relief. The arbitration shall be conducted in Palm Beach County, Florida and conducted by a single arbitrator, knowledgeable in the subject matter of the dispute. Except as provided below, the party bringing the action shall be responsible for paying all costs for arbitration, including the arbitrator's fees. Each party shall bear its own attorneys' fees (except if the matter is for the collection of a debt owed, the prevailing party shall be awarded its attorneys’ fees, all arbitration costs and arbitrator fees, in addition to all other applicable remedies). The arbitrator shall have no authority to award any punitive or exemplary damages; certify a class action; add any parties; vary or ignore the provisions of these Terms, and shall be bound by governing and applicable law. The arbitrator shall be willing to execute an oath of neutrality. The arbitrator shall render a written opinion setting forth all material facts and the basis of his or her decision within thirty (30) days of the conclusion of the arbitration proceeding.</p>
                            
                            <p class="mt-4 mx-3 md:mt-4 md:mx-8">(d) Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU HEREBY WAIVE YOUR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. In the event any litigation should arise between you and LxRoot in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.</p>
                            <p class="mt-4 mx-3 md:mt-4 md:mx-8">(e) Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THESE TERMS MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER USER</p>
